JMines  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steffenschroeder/jmines.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/steffenschroeder/jmines)
======
This is a Minesweepers clone which I use to practice techniques (TDD) or technologies (gradle / Java 8).
This is basically a clone of [Gnome Mines](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Mines). It uses its icons as well. That's why this repository needs to be licensed using GPL.

The frontend is based on the work of [Juliana Pe√±a](https://github.com/limitedmage): [JMines](http://julip.co/projects/jmines)
